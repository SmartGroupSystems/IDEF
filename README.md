# IDEF
A supplementary file for the paper “Instance-Driven Evolution of Constructive Heuristic Ensemble for the Stochastic Resource Allocation Problems with Time Windows” is available here. The instances and the codes involved in the experimental study are provided here. More detailed codes will be totally available once the paper has been published.
The description about 64 instance types with different kinds of problem features are given in the file "Instance classification"
The code to generate test instances of different kinds instance types, and the generated test instance files (.mat) are given in the file "Instance generation"
The code of IDEF is given in the file "IDEF"
