A supplementary file for the paper “Instance-Driven Evolution of Constructive Heuristic Ensemble for the Stochastic Resource Allocation Problems with Time Windows” is available here.

The description about 64 instance types with different kinds of problem features are given in the file "InstanceClassification".

The code to generate test instances of different kinds instance types, and the generated test instance files (.mat) are given in the file "InstanceGeneration".

The code of IDEF is given in the file "IDEF". (Detailed code will be totally available once the paper has been published.)
